This extension provides a web frontend library for use as a site set with Fluid
components in TYPO3 projects and other web applications with Fluid-based
templating. Components are defined via Fluid to provide vanilla HTML, CSS and
a tiny bit of JS. They follow an atomic-design pattern from small atoms via
larger molecules, organisms, and templates all the way to pages. This
implementation avoids reactive frameworks, CSS and JS preprocessors, as well
as largely JS-based web components in favour of delivering readable but
coherent HTML to end users. All components aim for semantic expressivity,
accessibility, and responsive layouts that adapt to various form factors from
mobile to tablet to laptop to desktop.
