This extension provides a web frontend library for use in TYPO3 and other web
applications with Fluid-based templating. Components are defined via Fluid to
provide vanilla HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JS. They follow an atomic-design
pattern from small atoms via larger molecules, organisms, and templates all
the way to pages. This implementation avoids reactive frameworks, CSS and JS
preprocessors, as well as largely JS-based web components in favour of
delivering readable but coherent HTML to end users. All components aim for
semantic expressivity, accessibility, and responsive layouts that adapt to
various form factors from mobile to tablet to laptop to desktop.
